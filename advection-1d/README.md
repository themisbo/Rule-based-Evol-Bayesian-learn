# 1D advection

The first step is to run the [grammatical evolution](1D_advection_gramevol.html) algorithm in `R` in order to derive the rules

The second step is to perform the [automated rule-based Bayesian regression analysis](1d_advection_analysis.ipynb) in `python`.

Note that for the data creation you need to run the [simulator.py](simulator.py) module, which requires code from the [Learning data-driven discretizations for partial differential equations](https://github.com/google/data-driven-discretization-1d) repository.
